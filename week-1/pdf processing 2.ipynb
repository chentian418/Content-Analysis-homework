Between the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the three months ended March 31, 2019, our revenues from developer services increased by 47% for RMB 12.5 million to RMB 18.3 million, which was mainly due to the growth in the number of customers from 894 to 1,275 year-over-year, while [indiscernible] (00:04:36) remained stable.',\n",
       " 'Second, on our data solution business lines, during the same period, our revenue from data solutions increased by 86% for RMB 140 million to RMB 212 million. The 86% growth was primarily due to the increase in both the number of paying customers and the increasing average spending per customer.',\n",
       " \"For targeted marketing business, the revenue have grown 90% year-over-year. This increase was mainly due to both the increase of number of paying customer and ARPU.

       " 'During the first quarter, which is traditionally a low and challenging quarter for the entire advertising market in China due to Chinese New Year, we managed to record healthy revenue growth. Our strategy to broaden our advertising customer verticals continue to be executed well, and we have seen solid results.',\n",
       " 'The highlight for this quarter is revenue mix is more balanced, with financial accounting for less than 40% of total ad revenue, down from 50% last quarter. And mobile gaming continues to gain momentum. It now accounts for 16% of total revenue, up from 10% in fourth quarter.',\n",

The combined revenues from other vertical solutions, including financial risk management, market intelligence, and iZone have increased by 64% from RMB 15 million to RMB 25 million year-over-year.

For financial risk management, the top paying customers in the quarter include [indiscernible] (00:07:59) 360 Finance, Bank of China Consumer Finance and the [ph] Pufa Bank (00:08:04).

       " 'The total operating expenses have increased by 70% to RMB 94.2 million year-over-year. In particular, R&D expenses increased by 75% to RMB 43 million. This was mainly due to the increase in staff costs, bandwidth and cloud cost and the depreciation charge of the servers.

       " \"My second question is about our accounts receivable. So I noticed that in our G&A expense this quarter, we said there's a bad debt provision of RMB 3 million. And also I noticed there's a – as a percentage of revenue, our account receivable have increased from a sequential basis. So, I just wonder, could you give us some color on this line, especially is there any seasonality about this in Q1? Thank you.\",\n",

So it's just a matter of reapplying the same provision policy and probably you know in the first quarter of this year is the Chinese New Year period, so a lot of accounts market paid because of debt. It's simply because of timing. So it's not because of the fact that debt has gone bad.\",\n",

So the payment period is kind of like a drag longer than usual. And the second reason is because our growth in the online gaming. The online gaming, we grow very strongly because in the Chinese New Year, actually the gaming, especially after the new licenses had been issued and the other gaming companies, they start to put more advertising dollar which also benefited us as well.',\n",
       " \"But for the gaming industry, customer typically, they pay a longer period of time than the other industry vertical. And also, this activity happened after Chinese New Year. So, it's purely because the cutoff date to calculating the\",\n",

We don't however expect any specific results of these tenders before 12 months.\",\n",
       " 'The main part of this construction backlog replenishment, we hope to come through the construction part of the concessions, which have been prequalified for and we will try to get.

But concessions is something which we are very much focused on. And we believe this segment will be a significant positive contributor to our cash flow generation. We have already started collecting dividends from this asset that have been put in operation. Definitely the Kastelli Airport which I referred to just before is expected to push further this business segment. And all-in-all, we are targeting [indiscernible] (00:06:32) concessions through new projects.\",\n",

Currently, we're recently in the procedure of acquiring further 20 megawatts (sic) [200 megawatts] (00:07:33) of wind park to the United States. The transaction has not been closed, but is under the process of being closed. We expect it to close in the coming months. So, by the year-end of 2019, we expect that the total installed capacity either on operation or under construction will reach the region of 1,600 megawatts.\",\n",
       " \"Having said this, we confirm that the effort we have started a decade ago of reinforcing the segments that are producing recurrent and visible long-term cash flows is well under way. I'm talking especially about concessions and renewable energy, without this meaning that the construction is not the core business of the group. Through which, also our concession competitiveness is enhanced.\",\n",

And looking forward, as I said before to further concentrate on segments like concessions, renewable energy where long-term cash flows are quite visible. We have to remind that our company has been one of the pioneers in renewable energy at a period where it was just a marginal activity back in 1996.

       " 'Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Sahil Vachani and welcome to the call for Max Ventures & Industries Limited. Just to give you an overview and oversight, we continue to drive our strategic direction under Max Ventures for building the Specialty Films business improving its performance and also embarking on our strategic charter for the real estate business.',\n",
       " \"At a macroeconomic level, both for the Packaging Films business and the Real Estate business, first, I'll take the Packaging Films business. The macroeconomic scenario has turned positive for the Packaging Films business. We believe that the worst is over for the industry and the demand and supply gap has started to narrow since Q4 of FY 2019; thus leading to an improvement in margins. There is no major capacity addition that has happened in\",\n",
       " 'the last quarter and we need to believe that there is no major capacity addition that is planned in the forthcoming 9 to 12 months as well.',\n",
       " 'For us, at Max Specialty Films, the value-added films and specialty films are the core and the focus of our operation. Contribution has been increasing from value-added films for us. A major driver for our business has been the drive towards sustainability. As you may know that the world and the feelings around plastic have been extremely negative. We, at Max Specialty Films, have taken cognizance of that and have been pioneers in the BOPP space to develop recyclable and sustainable polymer films purely on BOPP films and thus replacing potentially other film categories as well.',\n",
       " \"We're very confident that many of the large brands in the months to come will adopt this technology and for Max Specialty Films. Moreover, this is in line with the charter of most multinational companies that they have taken at a global level between 2021 and 2025, to move to completely sustainable and recyclable plastics.\",\n",
       " \"From a raw material perspective, the crude price is stable. And finally, from our joint venture with Toppan, we have received the clearances and have commended commercialization of certain sales. So, that's the overview particularly on the Packaging Films industry.\",\n",
       " 'Moving on now to Real Estate, we have continued our focus to grow the Real Estate space and happy to share that the first project which is Max Towers has been launched on April, completed before the anticipated timeline and under budget; thus demonstrating the capability of the new team under Max to turnaround a distressed project. This is the first of its kind turnaround for a distressed project in the NCR, particularly in the micro market of Noida.',\n",
       " 'Max Towers is currently 20% pre-leased and we are looking to lease it out completely in the coming year. The new leases we are confident will be at better rentals than the prevailing lease rentals. The product per se has attracted a lot of attention and positive communication from both end clients as well as the industry at large. This has set up Max Ventures and particularly our Real Estate business in a very competitive and compelling position.',\n",
       " 'If we look at the macroeconomics around the Real Estate industry, firstly, we believe that it is an extremely regional play for Real Estate and if we look at the NCR, we see a huge vacuum for a leading developer and there are hardly a few developers that are left in the NCR that have the balance sheet and the appetite for growth. We believe that Max can be positioned to be one of the preferred developers for the NCR market in the years to come. Given the brand, trust, credibility and reputation that Max enjoys, thanks to its various light businesses.',\n",
       " 'More so, with the team that we have put together and the ability of the team to not only manage regulatory and also – but also execute on the ground in terms of the construction, the project management and leasing, we are very confident that this team can grow from strength to strength.',\n",
       " 'Broadly, the real estate industry is seeing a corporatization that is taking place and we have seen the likes of Godrej, Bharti, Tata, Mahendra and many other brands who are trusted corporate brands making a play into real estate. The regulators, the customers, and the investor community at large have accepted this trend and is completely supportive of it, which is reflective of the increased private equity investments that one has seen in the real estate space.',\n",
       " 'In the last quarter, we saw the successful REIT that got launched by Embassy and Blackstone. And thus, has opened the gates for the future or more sustained viability of the commercial office space industry as well. The vacancies in the office space segment particularly for gray day assets are low and the demand uptake looks very positive, driven primarily by the growth in the co-working space.',\n",
       " 'Our second project which is Max House, Okhla, has also – is also going as per planned and we look to complete it within the scheduled budget and the timelines as well. There has been a high level of demand already in the Okhla location given that there is no new supply of gray day assets that are coming up there. We are also very happy to share that all Max developments whether they be in Dehradun or here in Max Towers, and as we can see from the early indicators in Okhla, demand a good premium to the micro market. And as we follow the real estate industry, we see that brands and companies that are able to command a premium within the same micro market compared to others are sustainable and we are hoping to build further on that means as well.',\n",
       " 'Our focus now is going to complete the leasing of Max Towers, but also aggressively pursue growth opportunities both across distressed assets and across the asset-light approach, focused primarily on the commercial office space. We have also received a lot of interest for other asset categories and the company is evaluating those as well.',\n",
       " 'From the investments vertical, we will look to monetize our investments that we have made in the next few years and do future investments related only to Real Estate or the Packaging business. The focus of the company is going to be to grow the Real Estate business to become the preferred brand in the national capital region and build out the Specialty Films business more from a Specialty Films perspective to drive higher EBITDA margin and profitability. The debt equity level at the group level is comfortable. There is no debt at the holding company level and very limited debt at the Real Estate business level. We have some debt at the Packaging Films business level which we are confident of managing given the performance of the business.',\n",
