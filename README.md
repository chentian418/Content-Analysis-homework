# Content-Analysis-homework1
Question 3 is listed in the separate file pdf processing 2.ipynb, in which I have developed some data prepossessing for the project I mentioned in question 4. 

This project includes processing the PDF files into pandas DataFrame. I have some trouble in converting the PDF directly to text, since the format is very irregular if I simply convert the PDF using pdfminer. Would you mind giving me some suggestions about the content analysis part? The example PDF and docx files are listed in the repository as well. Thank you!
